# salesforce-hybrid-asymmetric-encryption-in-flow

Mask personal information (PI) in Salesforce using RSA-2048 + AES-256. Salesforce holds only the **public key**; the **private key stays offline**. If the org's data and metadata are exported, the masked values cannot be decrypted.

A follow-up to [salesforce-aes256-data-masking-in-flow](https://github.com/jyltsang/salesforce-aes256-data-masking-in-flow).

## How it works

1. A Flow passes a record collection to the Apex action.
2. The action queues a batch job (chunk size set in the Flow).
3. For each record, the batch:
   - joins the chosen field values into one text payload,
   - encrypts it with a random AES-256 key,
   - encrypts that AES key with your RSA public key,
   - stores `<RSA hex>::<AES payload base64>` in the log field,
   - blanks the original fields and ticks the status checkbox.
4. You decrypt off-platform with the private key.

## Why not AES only?

| | AES only | This project |
|---|---|---|
| Key in Salesforce | Yes (admins and Apex can read it) | Public key only |
| Org compromise exposes data | Yes | No |
| Unmask inside Salesforce | Yes | No (offline only) |

## Files

- `FlowRSADataMaskingAction.cls`: invocable action for Flow; validates input and queues the batch
- `RSAMaskBatch.cls`: masks and encrypts records
- `BigInt.cls`: big-number maths for RSA (Apex has no native RSA encryption)
- `decrypt_envelope.py`: offline decryption

## Setup

### 1. Generate the keys (off-platform)

```bash
openssl genrsa -out private_key.pem 2048
openssl rsa -in private_key.pem -noout -modulus | cut -d= -f2
```

The second command prints the modulus (512 hex characters). The exponent is `10001`. Keep `private_key.pem` offline and never upload it.

### 2. Create the custom metadata

Setup → Custom Metadata Types → New:

- Label: `RSA Key Config`, Object Name: `RSA_Key_Config`
- Fields:
  - `Modulus__c`: **Text Area (Long)**
  - `Exponent__c`: Text (20)
- Manage Records → New: Name `Default_Key`, Modulus = the 512 characters, Exponent = `10001`

A plain Text field truncates the modulus to 255 characters. The batch checks the length and fails if it isn't 512.

### 3. Create fields on the target object

- **Log field:** Text Area (Rich), 131,072 characters
- **Status field:** Checkbox

### 4. Deploy the Apex classes

Deploy `BigInt`, `RSAMaskBatch` and `FlowRSADataMaskingAction`.

### 5. Build the Flow

Get the records, put the field API names into a text collection, then add the action **Asymmetrical RSA Masking (Async)**:

| Input | Value |
|---|---|
| Object | Record collection |
| Fields Name | Text collection of field API names (`MailingAddress` and `BillingAddress` expand to their parts) |
| Log Field | API name of the rich text log field |
| Checkbox Field | API name of the status checkbox |
| Batch Size | Optional, 1 to 200, default 1. Smaller chunks give each record more CPU headroom |

Call the action once per collection, not inside a loop.

### 6. Check the result

The action returns `QUEUED`, which only means the job was accepted. Check **Setup → Apex Jobs** for the real outcome. Already masked records are skipped.

## Decrypt (off-platform)

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install cryptography
python decrypt_envelope.py --key private_key.pem --file envelope.txt
```

Paste the log field value into `envelope.txt`. Add `--password` if the PEM is passphrase-protected. Output is one `fieldname:value` line per masked field, with lowercase API names.

## Limitations

- **No OAEP padding.** The AES key is wrapped with raw (textbook) RSA. Treat this as a proof of concept until it has been security reviewed.
- **Slow big-number maths in Apex.** This is why masking runs in an async batch with small chunks. Benchmark in your own org.
- **`getInstance()` truncated the long modulus to 255 characters in testing**, so the batch reads it with SOQL.
- **Losing the private key means the data cannot be recovered.**
